# T-Beam-Helium
Helium Network mapper using the TTGO T-Beam

This is based on the helium/longfi-arduino repo here https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/tree/master/TTGO-TBeam-Tracker. Follow the setup in that readme, then look here for any additional changes/customizations in this version.

This is intended to be used with the V1.1 TTGO T-Beam that comes with meshtastic installed by default (example https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001178678568.html).
